# Development Notes

## Learning Journey

### Security Implementation
- Started with basic auth (big mistake)
- Learned about JWT the hard way
- SSL certificates were confusing at first
- Rate limiting saved us from DDoS attacks
- Still learning about security best practices

### Database Challenges
- Started with SQLite (too slow)
- Moved to PostgreSQL (better performance)
- Had to learn about connection pooling
- Still optimizing queries
- Need to implement proper migrations

### Frontend Struggles
- React hooks were tricky at first
- TypeScript errors were annoying
- State management is still a work in progress
- Need to improve error handling
- UI/UX needs more work

### DevOps Learning
- Environment variables were a pain
- Logging saved our lives
- Still learning about deployment
- Need to set up proper CI/CD
- Monitoring is next on the list

## TODO List

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement proper database migrations
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Improve security measures
- [ ] Set up proper testing
- [ ] Add API documentation

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement caching
- [ ] Add more logging
- [ ] Improve performance
- [ ] Add more features
- [ ] Better error messages

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add more tests
- [ ] Improve documentation
- [ ] Add more examples
- [ ] Better code organization
- [ ] More comments

## Known Issues

1. Database
   - Connection pooling needs optimization
   - Some queries are slow
   - Need better error handling
   - Migration system is basic

2. Security
   - Rate limiting is basic
   - Need better password policies
   - SSL setup needs improvement
   - CORS is too permissive

3. Frontend
   - State management is messy
   - Error handling needs work
   - UI needs improvement
   - TypeScript types need cleanup

4. DevOps
   - No proper CI/CD
   - Logging needs improvement
   - Monitoring is basic
   - Deployment is manual

## Lessons Learned

1. Security
   - Always validate input
   - Use proper authentication
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Keep dependencies updated

2. Database
   - Use connection pooling
   - Optimize queries
   - Handle errors properly
   - Use proper migrations

3. Frontend
   - Use TypeScript
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use proper state management
   - Keep UI simple

4. DevOps
   - Use environment variables
   - Implement proper logging
   - Set up monitoring
   - Automate deployment

## Future Plans

1. Short Term
   - Fix known issues
   - Add more features
   - Improve documentation
   - Add more tests

2. Long Term
   - Implement proper CI/CD
   - Add more security features
